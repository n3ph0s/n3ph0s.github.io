## Whoami

Hi, my name is David Robinson. I am currently working as the Managing Partner and Practice Lead for Cloud & Cybersecurity at [&How Intelligence](www.andhowintelligence.com) based out of Singapore.

I have decided to create a personal blog to document my learnings as I believe in having a "craftsman's mindset" and continually striving for excellence in everything that I do.  I will cover a diverse range of content from "how-to" articles, thought leadership pieces, and writeups for [Hack the Box](https://www.hackthebox.eu/) and [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/).    

I have a constant passion for learning various subjects. Still, I am very passionate about security, which started over 30 years ago when I joined the Australian Army, which has continued evolving ever since.  Security is a diverse field, and at present, I am focusing on Red Teaming and Offensive Security.

When I am not hacking or learning more about hacking and security in general, I am a husband to my beautiful wife and our amazing children, which if you have ever had a call me when I am at home, you have probably heard them :)

I hope that you enjoy my content, and thank you for taking the time to read it!
